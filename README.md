# crazy-space-shooter

Crazy Space Shooter is simple game made in Unity3D.
The project is based on Unity Space Shooter and I used some of its 3D models in my game.
The player has to score point by shooting asteroids and enemies. 
An asteroid has to be hitten 3 times to be destroyed, an enemy only one time.
I created many power-ups, one of them is The Portal - if you go there, you have an extra bonus round.

All sripts are written in C# and are located in Assets/Scripts.
For those who don't have Unity3D on their computers but want to play the game
there is another repository with compiled version of this project.
